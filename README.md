# FastIR Collector

**We changed our approach to live forensics acquisition, which means FastIR Collector is no longer maintained. We recommend using our new [FastIR Artifacts collector](https://github.com/SekoiaLab/fastir_artifacts) instead**

## Concepts
This tool collects different artefacts on live Windows and records the results in csv or json files. With the analyses
of these artefacts, an early compromission can be detected.

## Downloads
Binaries can be found in the [release page](https://github.com/SekoiaLab/Fastir_Collector/releases) of this project.

## Requirements
- pywin32
- python WMI
- python psutil
- python yaml
- construct
- distorm3
- hexdump
- pytz

Alternatively, a `pip freeze` output is available in `reqs.pip`.

## Compiling
To compile FastIR, you will need [pyinstaller](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller).
Simply use ```pyinstaller pyinstaller.spec``` at the project root directory.
The binary will by default be in `/dist`.

Important: for x64 systems, check that your local python installation is also
in x64.

## Execution
- `./fastIR_x64.exe -h` for help
- `./fastIR_x64.exe --packages fast` extract all artefacts except dump and FileCatcher packages'
- `./fastIR_x64.exe --packages dump --dump mft` to extract MFT
- `./fastIR_x64.exe --packages all --output_dir your_output_dir` to set the directory output
(by default `./output/`)
- `./fastIR_x64.exe --profile you_file_profile` to set your own extraction profile. Documentation to
create your own profile can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/SekoiaLab/Fastir_Collector/wiki/Create-a-profile)
